# food-app-RN
A restaurant searching Application developed in React Native in conjuction with the Yelp API.
The App allows users to search a specific area/location for restaurants based on genre, e.g. Fast Food, Pizza, Pasta etc.
The App pulls down information on the restaurants via the Yelp API and with the help of Axio, not the built in fetch functionality - when it does this, it orders restaurants based on their price rating, which can be '£', '££' or '£££' and aligns them into horizontally scrollable components, the App also portrays information on their Star rating and how many reviews the restaurant has. 
The elements are also made clickable and more images can be viewed.
